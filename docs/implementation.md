# Implementation Plan: Improvements from Chat Interaction

## Context
Recent chat interaction:
- User: hi
- TheAgent: Of course! Please tell me what you need help with.
- User: can you delete the main.py
- TheAgent: The instruction is not clear on what action needs to be taken regarding the main.py file. Please provide more details or confirm if you want the code analyzed or removed.
- User: rmoved
- TheAgent: The instruction "rmoved" is unclear. Could you please provide more context or clarify your request?
- User: can you update script.py
- TheAgent: This action requires a file. Please provide one with --file or upload it.

## Features and Improvements to Implement

### 1. **Intent Recognition for File Operations**
- Detect user intent for file actions: delete, update, rename, move, etc.
- Use LLM or regex to classify intent from natural language ("delete main.py", "remove file", "update script.py").
- Map intent to safe, explicit actions.

### 2. **Clarification and Confirmation Flows**
- If a destructive action is detected (delete, overwrite), ask for explicit confirmation ("Are you sure you want to delete main.py? (y/n)").
- If the instruction is ambiguous, ask a clarifying question ("Do you want to analyze or remove main.py?").

### 3. **File Management Actions**
- Implement agent nodes for file operations:
  - Delete file
  - Rename/move file
  - Update/overwrite file
- Integrate these nodes into the orchestrator and allow LLM to select them.

### 4. **User Feedback and Error Handling**
- Provide clear, actionable feedback for unsupported or ambiguous requests.
- Suggest next steps ("You can say: 'delete main.py', 'summarize script.py', or 'update script.py'").

### 5. **Natural Language Understanding for Ambiguous Requests**
- Use LLM to rephrase or clarify unclear user input.
- If the user input is a typo or incomplete ("rmoved"), suggest corrections or ask for clarification.

### 6. **Suggestions for Next Actions**
- After completing an action, suggest related actions ("Would you like to see a summary of the file before deleting it?").

### 7. **Security and Safety Checks**
- For destructive actions (delete, overwrite), require confirmation.
- Optionally, implement a "trash" or undo feature for deleted files.
- Log all file operations for auditability.

### 8. **File Context Awareness**
- If the user refers to a file not provided with --file, prompt to upload or specify the file.
- Allow the user to select from available files in the workspace.

## Implementation Steps
1. Add intent recognition logic to the orchestrator (LLM or rule-based fallback).
2. Implement agent nodes for file management (delete, rename, update).
3. Add confirmation and clarification flows for destructive/ambiguous actions.
4. Enhance user feedback and error messages.
5. Add suggestions for next actions after each operation.
6. Implement safety checks and logging for file operations.
7. Update documentation and help messages to reflect new capabilities.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with version control (git) for safe file operations and undo.
- Support batch file operations ("delete all .tmp files").
- Add plugin system for custom file actions.
